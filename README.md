Bright Data (formerly known as Luminati) is a company that provides a data collection service. It helps businesses gather large amounts of information from the internet by using a network of proxy servers. These proxies allow companies to access websites anonymously, scrape data, and gather insights without being blocked.

In simpler terms, Bright Data helps businesses collect online data by hiding their identity, so they can gather information like prices, reviews, or other public data from websites without being detected. This service is commonly used for market research, competitive analysis, and other business needs.

### ✅Proxy Network: 
Bright Data has a large network of proxy servers around the world. These proxies allow businesses to access websites without revealing their real IP address. This helps avoid being blocked by websites while scraping data.

### ✅Mobile Proxies: 
Bright Data also offers proxies that simulate mobile device traffic, which is useful for gathering data from mobile apps and websites that behave differently on phones.

### ✅Search Engine Scraping: 
They provide tools specifically designed for scraping data from search engines like Google, which can be helpful for SEO analysis, keyword research, and tracking search rankings.
